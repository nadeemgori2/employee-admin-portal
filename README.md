# 📺 Employee Admin Portal

## Overview

This project is an Employee Admin Portal built in Angular 17.  
It provides secure user authentication, a feature-rich employee management table (CRUD, pagination, bulk actions), and detailed employee dashboards—all designed with clean code, modular architecture, and a focus on maintainability, testability, and responsive UI.

## 🚀 Features

- **Login** with role-based access (SOP1/SOP2)
- **Employee List** with:
  - Pagination (custom + Material)
  - Bulk selection and deletion
  - Responsive table with Bootstrap and Angular Material

  - State managed with NgRx, selectors, and effects
  - RxJS for async and UI state
- **Responsive UI:** Clean desktop and mobile support
- **Reusable Components:** Table, pagination, dialogs, etc.

## Development Notes

- ♻️ **Refactoring:**  
  Business logic, selection, and pagination are extracted into services for maintainability and testability.
- 📱 **Responsiveness:**  
  The UI leverages Bootstrap utilities and custom SCSS to ensure mobile support.
- 🎯  **Code Quality:**  
  Code was cleaned of unused/legacy files and unnecessary comments. Only useful documentation remains for reviewers.
- 🧪 **Unit Testing:**  
  Provided for all componentns, services and utility.

## Future Scope & Improvements

There's always room for improvement — including enhanced accessibility, refined layout structure, and more visually appealing styling using modern CSS practices and design systems.

- 🧱 **UI/UX Enhancements:**  
  More polishing can be done to align pixel-perfectly with advanced design systems. Button, input, and card styles can be further unified for a cohesive look and feel.
- 🌙 **Centralized Theming:**  
  Move all style variables (colors, typography, spacing) into a global SCSS file or Angular Material theme for easier maintenance and better reusability.
- 🎨 **Reusable Style Utilities:**  
  Refactor common styles (card, table, dialog, spacing) into mixins and utility classes to reduce duplication and speed up future features.
- 🧱 **Angular Signals Adoption:**  
  Leverage Angular Signals for even more reactive, high-performance UI—future-ready as the ecosystem evolves.
- ♿ **Accessibility (a11y):**  
  WAI-ARIA roles, keyboard navigation, and screen reader optimizations are partially in place; future improvements can add live region support, better tab order, and more.
- 📱 **Advanced Responsiveness:**  
  Further enhancements for tablet, landscape, and split-screen views can be added.
- 📚 **i18n/Localization:**  
  Easy to extend for multiple languages and locales.
- 🧰 **API Integration:**  
  Ready for real backend—just replace mock services.
- 🧪 **Testing:**  
  Add end-to-end (Cypress) and additional unit tests for components.
- ♻️ **Other:**  
  - User profile and role management
  - Notification system
  - Activity logging/auditing
  - Strong password validation
